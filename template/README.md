# Template Actions

For a visual quickstart [check out this video how to use the template actions!](https://www.loom.com/share/87c1c0909f444af69833bec8ce621635)

Template actions allow you to create folder structures, projects, and files with the click of a button.

To create your own custom templates, just right click on a file or folder and call the __Save as Template__

## Tokens

Use tokens, such as __[Client_Name]__, within your files and folders. Based on user input, the tokens will be replaced when instantiating the template.
When using tokens on a project template, the tokens will be stored on the project so that when using file and folder templates, the tokens will be reused.
