# Cinema 4D Actions

With [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d) actions you can do all kinds of interactions with C4D. 
Make sure you have both, C4D and the provided plugin installed. The actions in this folder are using the C4D commandline tool. Make sure that you set up the path to your installed commandline tool in the YAML file.

## Export FBX
