  inputs: # Inputs can have arbitrary names
    some_hardcoded_variable: This is a hardcoded string # This input value will never change
    
    ask_the_user_variable: # Optionally, we can ask the user for input
      message: What is your name? # The message that is displayed to the user
      default: ${username}  
    
    ask_the_user_once_variable: # And another input variable, this time we store the user provided value in the action settings
      message: What is your favorite app? # The message that is displayed to the user
      browse: file                        # Show a browse button so that the user can choose something on the file system. Valid values are folder, file
      store: action                       # Store the setting so that the user is only aksed once. If all inputs are stored, the user is not asked again. Valid valure are:
                                          # User: The value is stored for the user account. This means this value is the same for all actions
                                          # Action: The value is stored only for this action
                                          # Project: The value is stored for the current project. If no project is selected, it's stored for the user.
