## ‚ú® What are Anchorpoint Actions?
If you've worked with Visual Studio Code, you know the concept of extensions. Visual Studio Code is delivered as a lightweight application and can be customized to your needs with extensions.
An extension in Anchorpoint is like a collection of actions in Anchorpoint. For example, an action is a command, a hook, or an integration with another application.

## üóÇÔ∏è Example use cases

- [Create file/ folder templates and set naming conventions](https://www.anchorpoint.app/blog/automate-folder-structures-and-naming-conventions-without-writing-code)
- Map Drives
- Batch rename
- Build custom UIs
- Build integrations to your DCCs
- Connect to render farms and cloud providers

Everything where you have to do a lot of manual work (renaming files, copying files, constantly opening the DCC to load files and save them again or bugging your teammates to put data in the right place) you can automate with Actions.


## üöÄ Getting Started 
The best way to get started is looking and code examples and modify them.

![Source files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anchorpoint-Software/ap-actions-data/main/png/gettingStartedstep_3.png)

5. A right click on a folder will show the coding example actions. You can try them out.

![Execute Action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anchorpoint-Software/ap-actions-data/main/png/gettingStartedstep_4.png)

To get a good feeling just modify the greetings.yaml and greetings.py in the "ui" folder in the source code. Then in the folder context menu pick "UI / Greetings Dialog" which will execute that Action.
