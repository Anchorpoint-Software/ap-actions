# What is Anchorpoint
Anchorpoint is a version control solution for artists. It is fully compatible to Git and can be extended to other version control solutions. 

## What are Anchorpoint Actions?
Actions are plugins, that allow you to extend the UI of Anchorpoint or integrate it with other applications. Actions can be enabled and disabled for all Anchorpoint users in a particular workspace.

## Example use cases

- Create folder structures from templates and use your own naming conventions
- Map Drives
- Batch rename
- Build custom UIs
- Build integrations to your DCCs
- Convert image sequences to video
- Sync editor binaries for Unreal Engine based your current checked out commit (similar to UGS)
- Perform AI-based image tagging

Everything where you have to do a lot of manual work (renaming files, copying files, constantly opening the DCC to load files and save them again or bugging your teammates to put data in the right place) you can automate with Actions.
