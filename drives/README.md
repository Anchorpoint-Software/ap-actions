## Map Folder as Drive

With this action you can map any given folder to a drive (e.g. X:). This is super useful when dealing with broken absolute paths of scene files.

Example: 

A folder like **C:/Dropbox/Assets**  can be mapped so that a file C:/Dropbox/Assets/car.c4d can be accessed as **X:/Assets/car.c4d**


## Unmap drive

Allows you to unmount a previously mounted drive
